A short text game in python - mainly for me to figure out how to code

If you're going to pull request something, please merge into testing as I'm using master as I'm using master as a, not stable, but working branch. However, any code improvements are welcome. If you could explain what you're doing to me to further my understanding that'd be amazing.
